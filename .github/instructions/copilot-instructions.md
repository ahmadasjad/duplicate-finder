Keep these in mind:
- if you are going to run any command for the project, try to use `docker compose exec app` as prefix, as project is running in docker.
- If you are modifying a code portion, try not to move the content from line a to line x. Try to modify at the same line if possible. So that it's easy see the differences.
- when you are asking me a question, make it bold, so that I can see it easily.
- if you added some file, but later it's not needed, please remove it.
